# SQL Integration with Python
A beginner-friendly project showing how to use SQLite with Python for querying, updating, and visualizing data in Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Features
1. **Database Setup**  
   - Created a `sales` table with sample product data.  
   - Created a `customers` table with customer details.
  
2. **Data Insertion & Updates**  
   - Inserted sample data into both tables.  
   - Updated `sales` table with `customer_id` using `ALTER TABLE` and `UPDATE` queries.

3. **SQL Queries with Pandas**  
   - Queried data using SQL commands via `pd.read_sql()`.  
   - Demonstrated joins and aggregations.

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize revenue by product and by country.
